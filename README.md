There are certain conditions that might need to be met, though. You can only uninstall Windows 11 within 10 days of installation without losing your files. After that, you'll need to do what is known as a "clean install" of Windows 10 or your previous operating system. We'll touch on both methods in this handy guide.

## Rollback to Windows 10 and keep your files


The easiest way to uninstall Windows 11 is by rolling back to Windows 10. With this method, you will not lose any of your files, but there is a catch. You only have 10 days from when you initially updated to Windows 11 to go back to Windows 10. If this applies to you, follow our steps below. Otherwise, jump to the next section.

1. Open the Windows 11 settings menu with Windows key + I.

2. On the sidebar, click Windows update.

3. In the middle of your screen, click Advanced options.

4. Click Recovery followed by the Go back button.

5. Plug your laptop into a power outlet, and follow the steps on the screen.

After a few restarts, your PC will be set back to Windows 10 and will no longer be on Windows 11. This is the safest and easiest way to go back to Windows 10 as it keeps everything in place. You will not lose any of your files or documents, but any apps you installed while using Windows 11 will no longer be present.
